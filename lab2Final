##Lab 2
##Team Question Set


```{r}
nrow(choco)

```


```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)



library(ggplot2)



nrow(choco)

summary(choco$Review.Date)

sum(choco$Review.Date == 2006)


count = c()
k = 1
for (i in 2006: 2017){
  count[k] = sum(choco$Review.Date == i)
  k = k + 1
  
}


year = c(2006: 2017)
DataYear = cbind(year, count)


ggplot(data = as.data.frame(DataYear), aes(x = year, y = count)) + geom_bar(stat = "Identity")
  


```
## Individual Question Set
## 1.1
```{r}

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = choco, aes(Rating)) + geom_histogram()

```

## Based on the rating versus count histogram above, we can see that there a few outliers.  One at rating of 1 and one at rating 5.  Given the distribution of a normal curve, there will be outliers at the lower and upper bounds of the curve.


## 1.2

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = choco, aes(x =(Rating), y = (Cocoa.Pct))) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = choco, aes(x = Rating, y = Cocoa.Pct)) + geom_point()
```

## To an extent the cocoa percent does determine the rating.  Observing the scatterplot above, we see that in a vast majority of cases if the cookie has a cocoa percentage between 60 and 80 percent the cookie will on average have a raing between 2-4.  So essentially, when controlling for a percentage that is between 60 and 80 percent cocoa your cookie will have a rating between 2 and 4 in MOST cases.


## 3
```{r}
locations <- dplyr::filter(choco, Company.Location %in% c("U.S.A.", "France", "Canada"))

ggplot(data = locations, aes(x = Company.Location, y = Rating)) + geom_point()



```

## USA has the highest variation.  France has the second most variation and Canada has the least variation.



## Team Question

## Question: What is the relation between rating and review data/year?


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = choco, aes(x = Review.Date, y = Rating)) + geom_point()
```


## Answer: Over time the average rating improves.  As we see in the above scatterplot, the lower ratings are getting better and the average rating is increasing over time.
