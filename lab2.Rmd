## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)



library(ggplot2)



nrow(choco)

summary(choco$Review.Date)

sum(choco$Review.Date == 2006)


count = c()
k = 1
for (i in 2006: 2017){
  count[k] = sum(choco$Review.Date == i)
  k = k + 1
  
}


year = c(2006: 2017)
DataYear = cbind(year, count)


ggplot(data = as.data.frame(DataYear), aes(x = year, y = count)) + geom_bar(stat = "Identity")
